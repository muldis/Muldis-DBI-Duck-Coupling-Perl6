This distribution features the pure documentation file named
Muldis::DBP (Formal spec of an abstract database protocol for Perl 6)
and its support structure.

Muldis::DBP has 2 co-developed versions, for Perl 5 and Perl
6 respectively, which are distributed separately from each other.  But
while the 2 versions would be similar, they are explicitly not intended to
be drop-in substitutable for each other, as each would have some
differences that optimizes it for its host language.  Similarly, analogous
specifications will be written over time for other, non-Perl, languages.

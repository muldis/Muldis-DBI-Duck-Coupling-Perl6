This distribution features the pure documentation file named
Muldis::DBI::Duck_Coupling (Formal spec of a duck-coupling database
interface for Perl 6) and its support structure.

Muldis::DBI::Duck_Coupling has 2 co-developed versions, for Perl 5 and Perl
6 respectively, and which are distributed separately from each other.  But
while the 2 versions would be similar, they are explicitly not intended to
be drop-in substitutable for each other, as each would have some
differences that optimizes it for its host language.  Similarly, analogous
specifications will be written over time for other, non-Perl, languages.
